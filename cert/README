This directory contains certificate used to crawl OSG sites.

Create CSR by running something like
> umask 077; openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout crawlerkey.pem -subj "/CN=crawler\/monitor.grid.iu.edu"

Then OSG/PKI interface to make a service certificate request
> https://oim.grid.iu.edu/oim/certificaterequesthost
> cert/*.pem are in .gitignore list

You also need to register your certificate in VOMS under whichever the VO you want you run your test. GOC runs this under MIS VO, for example.
