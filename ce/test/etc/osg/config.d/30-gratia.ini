; The enable option indicates whether gratia should be enabled or 
; disabled.  It should be set to True or False
;
; You generally want Gratia enabled for any CE installation, in 
; addition SE installations may want to enable gratia to use 
; the gratia gridftp reporting
enabled = TRUE


; This setting specifies the resource that gratia will use to report
; accounting information, on a CE if you leave this blank, gratia will
; use the resource setting from the Site Information section

resource = AGLT2_CE_2

; This setting indicates which probes should be enabled for gratia
; The list should be given as probe_name1:host1:port1, probe_name2:host2:port2 
; where probe_name is either jobmanager or gridftp
; host is a fully qualified domain name
; port is the port that the server is listening on
; CEs should have entries for jobmanager probe
; SEs should use gridftp if they would like to enable gridftp transfer
; accounting 
;
; for convenience admins can use %(osg-jobmanager-gratia)s, and
; %(osg-gridftp-gratia)s for production sites
; and %(itb-jobmanager-gratia)s, and %(itb-gridftp-gratia)s for ITB sites
probes = %(osg-jobmanager-gratia)s
