;                          Subclusters
;===================================================================

; For each subcluster, add a new subcluster section.
; Each subcluster name must be unique for the entire grid, so make sure to not
; pick anything generic like "MAIN".  Each subcluster section must start with
; the words "Subcluster", and cannot be named "CHANGEME".

; There should be one subcluster section per set of homogeneous nodes in the
; cluster.

; This data is used for our statistics collections in the OSG, so it's important
; to keep it up to date.  This is important for WLCG sites as it will be used
; to determine your progress toward your MoU commitments!

; If you have many similar subclusters, then feel free to collapse them into
; larger, approximately-correct groups.

; See example below:

;[Subcluster CHANGEME]
; should be the name of the subcluster
;name = SUBCLUSTER_NAME
; number of homogeneous nodes in the subcluster
;node_count = NUMBER_OF_NODE
; Megabytes of RAM per node.
;ram_mb = MB_OF_RAM
; CPU model, as taken from /proc/cpuinfo.  Please, no abbreviations!
;cpu_model = CPU_MODEL_FROM_/proc/cpuinfo
; Should be something like:
; cpu_model = Dual-Core AMD Opteron(tm) Processor 2216
; Vendor's name -- AMD or Intel?
;cpu_vendor = VENDOR_AMD_OR_INTEL
; Approximate speed, in MHZ, of the chips
;cpu_speed_mhz = CLOCK_SPEED_MHZ
; Must be an integer.  Example: cpu_speed_mhz = 2400
; Platform; x86_64 or i686
;cpu_platform = x86_64_OR_i686

; Number of CPUs (physical chips) per node
;cpus_per_node = #_PHYSICAL_CHIPS_PER_NODE
; Number of cores per node.
;cores_per_node = #_CORES_PER_NODE
; For a dual-socket quad-core, you would put cpus_per_node=2 and
; cores_per_node=8

; Set to true or false depending on inbound connectivity.  That is, external
; hosts can contact the worker nodes in this subcluster based on their hostname.
;inbound_network = FALSE
; Set to true or false depending on outbound connectivity.  Set to true if the
; worker nodes in this subcluster can communicate with the external internet.
;outbound_network = TRUE

; Non-mandatory attributes
; The amount of swap per host in MB
;  swap_mb = 4000
; The per-core SpecInt 2000 score.  This is usually computed for you.
;  SI00 = 2000
; The per-core SpecFloat 2000 score.  This is usually computed for you
;  SF00 = 2000

; Mandatory for WLCG reporting
; The per-core HEPSPEC score.  See your VO representative for more information.
;  HEPSPEC = 8
; The conversion factor from HEPSPEC to SI2K is accepted to be 250.

; Here's a full example.  Remember, globally unique names!
; [Subcluster Dell Nodes UNL]
; name = Dell Nodes UNL
; node_count = 53
; ram_mb = 4110

;===================================================================

; For each storage element, add a new SE section.
; Each SE name must be unique for the entire grid, so make sure to not

; There are two main configuration types; one for dCache, one for BestMan

; Don't forget to change the section name!  One section per SE at the site.

; Name of the SE; set to be the same as the OIM registered name
name = AGLT2_SE

; How to collect data; the most generic implementation is called "static"

; WLCG sites with a SE *must* use bestman, dcache, or dcache19
; Implementation and version of your SRM SE; usually dcache or bestman

; Version refers to the SE version, not the SRM version.

; dCache example: version = 1.9.1
; Default paths for all of your VOs; VONAME is replaced with the VO's name.

; Comma-separated list of VO:PATH pairs.  Not required.
; vo_dirs=cms:/mnt/bestman/cms, dzero:/mnt/bestman2/atlas

; If your SE provides a POSIX-like mount on your worker nodes, uncomment
; the following line:
; mount_point = /,/
; POSIX-like file systems include Lustre, NFS, HDFS, xrootdfs
; dCache site should not uncomment the line
; The value of `mount_point` should be two paths; first, the path where the
; file system is mounted on the worker nodes, followed by the exported directory
; of the file system.  If you mount your file system on the worker nodes with
; the following command:
;    mount -t nfs nfs.example.com:/exported/dir /mnt/nfs
; then mount_point should look like this:
;    mount_point = /mnt/nfs,/exported/dir

; By default, all VOs are advertised as having access to your SE. If you want only a subset of 
; VOs to be advertised, list them as a comma separated list in the allowed_vos setting 
; allowed_vos = 

; For BestMan-based SEs, uncomment and fill in the following.
;  provider_implementation = bestman
;  implementation = bestman

; Set to TRUE if the bestman provide can use 'df' on the directory referenced
; above to get the freespace information.  If set to false, it probably won't
; detect the correct info.
;  use_df = True

; For dCache-based SEs, uncomment and fill in the following
; How to collect data; set to 'dcache' for dcache 1.8 (additional config req'd
; for this case), 'dcache19' for dcache 1.9, or 'static' for default values.
; provider_implementation = dcache19
;  implementation = dcache
;  If you use the dcache provider, see 
; http://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/InformationServices/DcacheGip
