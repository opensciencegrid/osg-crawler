[Condor]
; This section has settings for configuring your CE for a Condor job manager

; The enabled setting indicates whether you want your CE to use a Condor job 
; manager
; valid answers are True or False
enabled = TRUE

; The condor_location setting should give the location of condor install directory
condor_location = DEFAULT

; The condor_location setting should give the location of condor config file,
; This is typically  /etc/condor/condor_config with rpm installations of condor
; or $CONDOR_LOCATION/etc/condor_config if you are using a tarball install of 
; condor
; If you leave this set to DEFAULT, configure-osg will attempt to
; determine the correct value.
condor_config = DEFAULT

; The job_contact setting should give the contact string for the jobmanager 
; on this CE (e.g. host.name/jobmanager-condor) 
job_contact = gate02.grid.umich.edu/jobmanager-condor

; The util_contact should give the contact string for the default jobmanager
; on this CE (e.g. host.name/jobmanager)
util_contact = gate02.grid.umich.edu/jobmanager

; This setting is optional and will allow globus to accept limited proxies if set. 
; Changing this is not needed for almost all sites. If set to True it will add 
; the "accept_limited" option into /etc/grid-services/jobmanager-managed-fork. 
; If it is set to False or not set then that prefix will not be added.
;
; By default this is set to False
;
; Most sites will not need to change this 
; accept_limited = False
